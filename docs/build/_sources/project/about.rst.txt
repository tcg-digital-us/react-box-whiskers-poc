This tutorial serves to help developers set up a basic React project
powered by Elasticsearch for the development of elastic data
visualizations using Vega.

The goal of this project is to create a single-page web-app using the React framework that 
displays an interactive box-and-whiskers data visualization using the Vega visualization 
grammar with data retrieved from a backend server connected to an Elasticsearch data-store.

Throughout the process of working on this project it became apparent that there would be
many different pieces involved, so we have done the best we can to cover all information
required.

Requirements
------------

-  Basic background/understanding of JavaScript
