Download and Manage an Elasticsearch Instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the time of writing this, the current binary version of Elasticsearch
available is v8.3.3. The platform download variants available are:

In this tutorial we will be working in the WSL2 environment on Windows,
so we will be using the linux variant for x86_64. Your environment may
differ, so choose the variant appropriate for your system and install it
accordingly.

Inside WSL we can run:

.. code:: bash

   $ cd ~/
   $ mkdir vre_tutorial
   $ cd vre_tutorial
   $ curl -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-8.3.3-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
   $ tar -xzvf elasticsearch-8.3.3-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
   $ cd elasticsearch-8.3.3

After downloading it, we will run it once to configure it so that we can
get the password for the default 'elastic' user that is generated after
running.

.. code:: bash

   $ ./bin/elasticsearch

After you wait for Elasticsearch to fully initialize, you should see an
ouptut similar to this below:

.. code:: bash

   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   ✅ Elasticsearch security features have been automatically configured!
   ✅ Authentication is enabled and cluster connections are encrypted.

   ℹ️  Password for the elastic user (reset with `bin/elasticsearch-reset-password -u elastic`):
     2halHiMGAkkLAig-bYi8

   ℹ️  HTTP CA certificate SHA-256 fingerprint:
     a62ded01ae5f23c34b1887a76ba8503bc3f96dea03255c733d87913506ab9083

   ℹ️  Configure Kibana to use this cluster:
   • Run Kibana and click the configuration link in the terminal when Kibana starts.
   • Copy the following enrollment token and paste it into Kibana in your browser (valid for the next 30 minutes):
     eyJ2ZXIiOiI4LjMuMyIsImFkciI6WyIxNzIuMTguMTkyLjIxMzo5MjAwIl0sImZnciI6ImE2MmRlZDAxYWU1ZjIzYzM0YjE4ODdhNzZiYTg1MDNiYzNmOTZkZWEwMzI1NWM3MzNkODc5MTM1MDZhYjkwODMiLCJrZXkiOiJHa1h1ZzRJQmp6a1JkU0pHbGdKcDpCRTlkdy11YVNCT2NaMFdYQnRLTlV3In0=

   ℹ️  Configure other nodes to join this cluster:
   • On this node:
     ⁃ Create an enrollment token with `bin/elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token -s node`.
     ⁃ Uncomment the transport.host setting at the end of config/elasticsearch.yml.
     ⁃ Restart Elasticsearch.
   • On other nodes:
     ⁃ Start Elasticsearch with `bin/elasticsearch --enrollment-token <token>`, using the enrollment token that you generated.

Copy the 'password for the elastic user' and save it somewhere because
we will need it again later.

.. ATTENTION::

   *The password for the elastic user is only shown once upon initial startup, so make sure you write it down!*

.. NOTE::

   *Use* ``Ctrl+C`` *to kill Elasticsearch in the command line. It can take a little while
   to exit gracefully.*

CORS/SOP
^^^^^^^^

Upon first successful startup, Elasticsearch populates its configuration file at 
``config/elasticsearch.yml``. We can add to this file to set Elasticsearch to 
allow requests from all origins. These changes wont be evaluated until Elasticsearch
is killed and started again.

.. code:: python

   # allow CORS requests from https://app.elasticvue.com
   http.cors.enabled: true
   http.cors.allow-origin: "*"

   # and if your cluster uses authorization:
   http.cors.allow-headers: X-Requested-With,Content-Type,Content-Length,Authorization

.. NOTE:: 

   If you haven't heard of Same-Origin Policiy, or Cross Origin Resource Sharing,
   you should dedicate some time to understanding both, as it can be the source
   of headache and misery for many a new developer.
